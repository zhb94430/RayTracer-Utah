Makefile should compile the project correctly on macOS.

Alternatively, the included XCode project can also be used to compile.

To run, simply type $ ./RayTracer
This will generate the Result.png and ZBuffer.png

Scene is hardcoded to SceneFiles/Project1Example.xml <- Will be improved on next project
